--   Modification of the 3d BLOCK distribution to avoid large processor 
     unbalancing of computational load

--   Restart with different domain size

!    Refinement of the procedure for random perturbation of the inlet 
     conditions to include "non-top-hat" velocity profiles

!!   Constant pressure boundary conditions (for gas)

!!   New Module to check the residuals of the model equations at each
     iteration

!!!  Optimization procedure for atmospheric cells without particles 

!!   Variable time-stepping

!    Check runge-kutta coefficients for high-order schemes

!!   Documentation for immersed boundaries and topography

!    Revise documentation for sample input files

!!!! Bottom Outflow for sedimentation

*    Pseudo-fluid approximation

Expected time needed for completion:
!    : some hours
!!   : a day
!!!  : some days
