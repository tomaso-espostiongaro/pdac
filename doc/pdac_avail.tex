\section{\PDAC\ Availability and Installation}
\label{section:avail}

\PDAC\ is distributed freely for non-profit use.
\PDAC\ \PDACVERSION\ is based on the Charm++ messaging system and the
Converse communication layer ({\tt http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/})
which have been ported to a wide variety of parallel platforms.
This section describes how to obtain and install \PDAC\ \PDACVERSION.

\subsection{How to obtain \PDAC}

\PDAC\ may be downloaded from {\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/PDAC/}.
You will be required to provide minimal registration information and
agree to a license before receiving access to the software.
Both source and binary distributions are available.

\subsection{Platforms on which \PDAC\ will currently run}
\PDAC\ should be portable to any parallel platform with a
modern C++ compiler to which Charm and Converse have been ported.
Precompiled \PDAC\ \PDACVERSION\ binaries are available for the following platforms:  
\begin{itemize}
\item Windows (NT, etc.) on Intel processors 
\item Mac OS X (also called Darwin) on PowerPC processors
\item AIX on RS/6000 processors 
\item HP-UX on PA-RISC processors 
\item Linux on Intel and Alpha processors 
\item Scyld Beowulf on Intel processors 
\item Clustermatic 3 on Intel processors 
\item Solaris on Sparc processors (with and without MPI)
\item Tru64 Unix on Alpha processors (with and without MPI)
\item Cray T3E 
\item IBM RS/6000 SP (using MPI)
\item Compaq AlphaServer SC (using the Quadrics Elan library)
\item SGI Origin 2000 (with and without MPI) 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Compiling \PDAC}

We provide complete and optimized binaries for all
platforms to which PDAC has been ported.
It should not be necessary for you to compile
PDAC unless you wish to add or modify features
or to improve performance by using an MPI library
that takes advantage of special networking hardware.

Directions for compiling PDAC are contained in the release notes,
which are available from the PDAC web site
{\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/PDAC/}
and are included in all distributions.

\subsection{Documentation}

All available \PDAC\ documentation is available for download without
registration via the \PDAC\ web site
{\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/PDAC/}.
